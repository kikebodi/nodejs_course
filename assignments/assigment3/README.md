Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will continue the exploration of user authentication. We have already set up the REST API server to validate an ordinary user. Now, you will extend this to verify an Admin and grant appropriate privileges to an Admin. At the end of this assignment, you would have completed the following:

Check if a verified ordinary user also has admin privileges.
Allow an ordinary user to only perform GET operatioins
Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database
Assignment Requirements

This assignment is divided into three tasks as detailed below:

Task 1

In this task you will implement a new function named verifyAdmin() in verify.js file. This function will check an ordinary user to see if s/he has Admin privileges. In order to perform this check, note that all users have an additional field stored in their records named admin, that is a boolean flag, set to false by default. Furthermore, when the user's token is checked in verifyOrdinaryUser() function, it will load a new property named decoded to the request object. This will be available to you if the verifyAdmin() follows verifyOrdinaryUser() in the middleware order in Express. From this req object, you can obtain the admin flag of the user's information by using the following expression:



1
     req.decoded._doc.admin
You can use this to decide if the user is an administrator. The verifyAdmin() function will return Next(); if the user is an admin, otherwise it will return Next(err);

Task2

In this task you will update all the routes in the REST API to ensure that ordinary users are restricted only to perform GET operations. On the other hand, Admins can perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Update the code for all the routers to support this.

Task 3

In this task you will now activate the /users REST API end point. When an Admin sends a GET request to http://localhost:3000/users you will return the details of all the users. If an ordinary user performs this operation, you should return a reply with the status of 403, and a message "You are not authorized to perform this operation!".
Review criterialess 
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Task 1

You have implemented the verifyAdmin() function in verify.js.
The verifyAdmin() function will allow you to proceed forward along the normal path of middleware execution if you are an Admin
The verifyAdmin() function will prevent you from proceeding further if you do not have Admin privileges, and will send an error message to you in the reply.
Task 2

An ordinary user is restricted only to perform the GET operation on the resources/REST API end points.
An Admin (who must be first checked to make sure is an ordinary user), can perform the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on any of the resources/ REST API end points.
Task 3

A GET operation on http://localhost:3000/users by an Admin will return the details of the registered users
An ordinary user (without Admin privileges) cannot perform the GET operation on http://localhost:3000/users.
